          "I've known Sean for over a decade, from his early days at McDonald's to becoming a boss at a casino in West Virginia, and now nearing graduation at Michigan State University. Sean is the epitome of hard work and dedication. From staffing and scheduling to training, he's always gone the extra mile in his professional roles.

          At McDonald's, he took extra hours and performed tasks to perfection. As a manager, his organizational skills shined, ensuring staff were where they needed to be. He constantly improved himself—whether it was moving up in his career, taking an unfathomable number of classes, or working GrubHub gigs to make ends meet.
          
          Sean applies himself fully, whether in academics or work. I have no doubt he will graduate with top marks, poised for a bright future. To employers considering him: hiring Sean isn't just a good decision—it's a no-brainer. His commitment and skill set are unmatched.
          
          On a personal level, Sean is the best friend anyone could ask for. Both my family and I consider him as such. His personal qualities reflect his professional ones—smart, dedicated, and supremely reliable.
          
          In short, if you want someone who embodies dedication, intelligence, and growth, Sean is your ideal candidate."

      <h3>Thoughts from my mother...</h3>

        "From mowing lawns at age 11 to a stint in the Air Force as a communications specialist, Sean's work ethic has always been evident. After military service, he returned to McDonald's, this time as an Assistant General Manager, before transitioning to FireKeepers Casino in Battle Creek. Gaining valuable experience, he then moved to a West Virginia casino as a supervisor in the table games department.

        In 2020, amidst the challenges of COVID and remote learning, Sean returned to academics, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Michigan State University. Balancing rigorous coursework with a part-time job delivering food, he often describes his educational journey as his toughest job yet. But true to form, Sean has never shied away from challenges; he confronts them head-on.
        
        As his graduation looms closer, his resilience and determination make me incredibly proud. The challenges he's overcome speak volumes about his character, and I'm excited to see where his Computer Science degree will lead him next."
